Here are the basic rules of blackjack:

The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards.
The cards are ranked as follows: Ace (A), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K).
Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards at the start of the round.
The player can choose to "hit" and be dealt an additional card to try and improve their hand, or "stand" and keep their current hand.
If the player's hand has a value greater than 21, they are "busted" and lose the game.
If the player chooses to stand, it is then the dealer's turn. The dealer must hit until their hand has a value of 17 or more, and then must stand.
If the dealer goes over 21, they are busted and the player wins.
If both the player and the dealer stand, the winner is the one with the hand closest to 21.
To play a game of blackjack, follow these steps:

Shuffle the deck of cards.
Deal two cards to each player, including the dealer.
Calculate the value of each player's hand. Aces are worth 1 or 11, face cards are worth 10, and other cards are worth their face value.
If the player has 21 (an Ace and a 10-valued card), they have blackjack and win the game unless the dealer also has blackjack, in which case it is a tie.
If the player does not have blackjack, they must decide whether to hit or stand. To hit, the player is dealt another card and the value of their hand is recalculated. If the player's hand goes over 21, they are bust and lose the game.
If the player stands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer must hit until their hand has a value of 17 or more, and then must stand.
If the dealer busts, the player wins. If the dealer does not bust, the winner is the one with the hand closest to 21.
